# Command center

Use this guide to run the Tauri command center against a local stack or a Kubernetes deployment, and to understand its role as a control-plane client.

## Build Command Center

`runinator-command-center` is a Tauri client. Run it against the local stack with:

```bash
bash scripts/run-local.sh ui
```

The default local stack advertises and serves the API on `127.0.0.1:8080`.
For Kubernetes, gossip is disabled and the web service is available through the
`runinator-ws` Service instead. Use the K8s UI launcher to create the
port-forward and pass the concrete API URL:

```bash
bash scripts/run-k8s.sh ui
```

The command center checks `RUNINATOR_COMMAND_CENTER_SERVICE_URL`,
`RUNINATOR_SERVICE_URL`, then `WS_API_BASE_URL` before falling back to gossip.
It is a pure client and does not execute workflow actions itself; use the
desktop agent below to run actions on your own machine.
